           HELLO AND WELCOME TO OUR WEBSITE SAHIL ART... First of all I called myself an artist because an artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art.
            So i am one of them who likes to creating, practicing and spending my most times in art. I started
            my art journy into my childhood. When I am 6 years old, I used to draw so many portraits which is on my sisters G.K book.
            Since childhood, I make so many drawings and gaining so much exprience into it. I never going for any drawing classes for
            enhancing my skills because I don't have much money to spend into it. It is all from my childhood experiences. When youtube came in my life, I started watching and following so many creator
            Then I thought, The creator I am watching.. He is also like my age and earning also. That time I decided to make a yputube channel.
            And also my board examination are over. So, I have fully licsensed to focus on my art channel. In 2020, I start my youtube channel. And in nearly 3 month, I uploaded more then 100 videos.
            Because I am beginner in editting. That's why I did't get much appreciation and also subscribers counts. But my drawings have enough power to scale in this field. From my talent and skills I finally completed the milestone of 1k subscribers
            in 9 months. Just like I born a baby in this time periods. I am very happy because my channel statics are growing like a mini rocket. And also my channel are monetized because I completed the milestone of 4000 hours watchtime in january 2021.
            All are going well but you know every day has night and that night was very dark and painful. Because When I am doing the preperation of my 12th board, that time my channel are slowly getting fishing attack and I lost my channel ownership.
